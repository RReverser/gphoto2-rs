use gphoto2::Context;
use std::path::Path;

fn main() {
  // Everything starts from a context
  let context = Context::new().expect("Failed to create context");
  // From the context you can detect cameras
  let camera = context.autodetect_camera().expect("Failed to autodetect camera");

  // And take pictures
  let file_path = camera.capture_image().expect("Could not capture image");
  file_path
    .download(&camera, Path::new(&file_path.name().to_string()))
    .expect("Failed to download image");
